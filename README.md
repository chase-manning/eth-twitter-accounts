# ETH Twitter accounts

This repository contains a dump of [15,451 Twitter accounts and their Ethereum address](https://github.com/chase-manning/eth-twitter-accounts/blob/main/eth-twitter.csv).

## Notes

1. The source data for this was a [dataset matching Twitter accounts to ENS](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/ens_twitter_accounts) based on users including it in their Twitter name.
2. The source dataset is a bit old now, so some of the data might not be up to date.
3. The script used to download the address from the ENS names is [here](https://github.com/chase-manning/eth-twitter-accounts/blob/main/script/index.js).
4. If you would like to be added to or removed from this list please [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/chase_manning_) and I'll make that change for you! Or feel free to open a PR.
